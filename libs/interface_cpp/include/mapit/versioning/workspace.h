/**
 * @brief A Workspace object represents an editable state/version of all maps.
 * Workspace (without raw) is the interface for users to invoke parameterized Operators to indirectly edit objects.
 * Changes can be done in a workspace without creating new commits. Workspaces are persistent on harddrive and do
 * not only exist in RAM (just like a git working directory persists on harddrive). When they are commited, the
 * workspace gets transformed to the final commit. At this stage, it can not be changed anymore (all objects are
 * immutable). Objects (entities, trees) may not have an objectId in a workspace. One can not use the commit- and
 * objectIds, because these are changing. Ids are generated during a commit. Some objects, which have not changed
 * since the last commit, may have an objectId. These objects may be copied on the first write access. However if
 * the history of the objects is traceable and the object can bes restored from other data, the system may over-
 * write the data without copying. OperationDescriptors are collected while the workspace is active. Operations
 * inside the list can have parameters (objectIds) which are only temporary in the system. When replayed,
 * dependencymanagement tries to compute all Operations which have all their parameters ready.
